<h1>✨ ● SECURITY POLICE ● ✨</h1>

This API is a collaborative public project that grows and develops slowly, developers and supporters strive to ensure security and speed in using this package and this is not possible without constant regulation of the project. Sometimes the smallest things can become big and in those cases, it's always good to report them to us!

## `1.` I FOUND AN ERROR
If you have seen the code and found any part that may be vulnerable to your application, hinder performance or bring other adverse effects to your application, it is extremely important to report this as a security issue. Open an Issue denouncing such problem found by you that in a few moments (or longer) your problem will be placed as a priority and little by little it will be corrected until it no longer presents problems!

Your help is extremely important for a quick and practical evolution, because it is YOU who will develop and make your applications and having feedback on what to improve is extremely important, that said, do not hesitate to report problems or things that can be improved.
